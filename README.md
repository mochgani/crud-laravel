# Crud Generator Laravel 9 and 10 (your time saver)

Crud Generator Laravel is a package that you can integrate in your Laravel to create a REAL CRUD. It includes :

- **Controller** with all the code already written
- **Views** (index, create, edit, show)
- **Model** with relationships
- **Request** file with validation rules
- **Migration** file

## Installation

1\. Run the following composer command:

``` composer require mrdebug/crudgen --dev ```

2\. If you don't use Laravel Collective Form package in your project, install it:

``` composer require laravelcollective/html ```

<sub>(Note: This step is not required if you don't need views.)</sub>

3\. Publish the configuration file, stubs and the default-theme directory for views:

``` php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Mrdebug\Crudgen\CrudgenServiceProvider" ```


## Usage

### Create CRUD (or REST API)

Let's illustrate with a real life example : Building a blog

A `Post` has many (hasMany) `Comment` and belongs to many (belongsToMany) `Tag`

A `Post` can have a `title` and a `content` fields

Let's do this ðŸ™‚

<sub>If you need a REST API instead of CRUD, [read this wiki](https://github.com/misterdebug/crud-generator-laravel/wiki/Make-a-complete-REST-API-instead-of-CRUD)</sub>

#### CRUD generator command :

``` php artisan make:crud nameOfYourCrud "column1:type, column2" ``` (theory)

``` php artisan make:crud post "title:string, content:text" ``` (for our example)

<sub>[Available options](https://github.com/misterdebug/crud-generator-laravel/wiki/Available-options-when-you-use-make:crud-command)</sub>

<sub>[Generate CRUD with livewire datatable](https://github.com/misterdebug/crud-generator-laravel/wiki/Generate-CRUD-with-livewire-datatable)</sub>

When you call this command, the controller, views and request are generated with your fields (in this case, title and content).

Now let's add our relationships (`Comment` and `Tag` models) :

We add a `hasMany` relationship between our `Post` and `Comment`
and a `belongsToMany` with `Tag`

Two migrations are created (`create_posts` AND `create_post_tag`).

`create_posts` is your table for your `Post` model

`create_post_tag` is a pivot table to handle the `belongsToMany` relationship

`Post` model is generated too with both relationships added

### Migration

Both migration files are created in your **database/migrations** directory. If necessary edit them and run :
   
``` php artisan migrate ```

## Remove a CRUD

You can delete all files (except migrations) created by the `make:crud` command at any time. No need to remove files manually :

``` php artisan rm:crud nameOfYourCrud --force ```

``` php artisan rm:crud post --force ``` (in our example)

The `--force` flag (optional) deletes all files without confirmation
